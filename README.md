# co-spec-coll-share
This MySQL database is a proof of concept for the sharing of records between a small
consortium of 2 libraries, 1 museum and 1 archive. The example data is fictional and refers to
locations mentioned in H.P. Lovecraftâ€™s Cthulhu mythos, along with actual historic books that are
referenced within his oeuvre. This database allows for the 4 locations in the Essex County
consortium to share their records. Stakeholders can know where an item of interest currently
resides, how many copies are held throughout the systems, all of the held works by a particular
author, as well as which items are available to view and/or reserve. The field lengths are
designated with both efficiency and scaling in mind
